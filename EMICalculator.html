              Equated Monthly Installment - EMI for short - is the amount
              payable every month to the bank or any other financial institution
              until the loan amount is fully paid off. It consists of the
              interest on loan as well as part of the principal amount to be
              repaid.
            </p>

            <p>
              The sum of principal amount and interest is divided by the tenure,
              i.e., number of months, in which the loan has to be repaid. This
              amount has to be paid monthly. The interest component of the EMI
              would be larger during the initial months and gradually reduce
              with each payment.

              EMI Calculator is easy to use, intuitive to understand and is
              quick to perform. You can calculate EMI for home loan, car loan,
              personal loan, education loan or any other fully amortizing loan
              using this calculator.
            </p>
            <p>
              Enter the following information in the EMI Calculator: Principal
              loan amount you wish to avail Loan term (months or years) Rate of
              interest (percentage) EMI in advance OR EMI in arrears (for car
              loan only)The payment schedule table showing payments made every
              month / year for the entire loan duration is displayed along with
              a chart showing interest and principal components paid each year.
              A portion of each payment is for the interest while the remaining
              amount is applied towards the principal balance.
            </p>
            <p>
              During initial loan period, a large portion of each payment is
              devoted to interest. With passage of time, larger portions pay
              down the principal. The payment schedule also shows the
              intermediate outstanding balance for each year which will be
              carried over to the next year.
            </p>

              We suggest that you calculate floating / variable rate EMI by
              taking into consideration two opposite scenarios, i.e., optimistic
              (deflationary) and pessimistic (inflationary) scenario. Loan
              amount and loan tenure, two components required to calculate the
              EMI are under your control.
            </p>
            <p>
              But interest rate is decided by the banks & HFCs based on rates
              and policies set by government. As a borrower, you should consider
              the two extreme possibilities of increase and decrease in the rate
              of interest and calculate your EMI under these two conditions.
              Such calculation will help you decide how much EMI is affordable,
              how long your loan tenure should be and how much you should
              borrow.
